    <h2>Collection of General Information When Visiting Our Website</h2>
    <h3>Type and Purpose of Processing:</h3>
    <p>When you access our website, i.e., when you do not register or otherwise submit information, general information
        is automatically collected.
        This information (server log files) includes details such as the type of web browser, the operating system used,
        the domain name of your Internet service provider, your IP address, and similar data.</p>
    <p>This information is processed particularly for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensuring a smooth connection to the website,</li>
        <li>Ensuring the smooth use of our website,</li>
        <li>Assessing system security and stability, and</li>
        <li>Optimizing our website.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use your data to draw conclusions about your person. Information of this kind is, if necessary,
        anonymized and statistically evaluated to optimize our online presence and the underlying technology.</p>
    <h3>Legal Basis and Legitimate Interest:</h3>
    <p>The processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR based on our legitimate interest in
        improving the stability and functionality of our website.</p>
    <h3>Recipients:</h3>
    <p>Recipients of the data may be technical service providers who act as processors for the operation and maintenance
        of our website.</p>
    <h3>Storage Duration:</h3>
    <p>The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose of collection. For data that serves the
        provision of the website, this is generally the case when the respective session ends.</p>
    <p>In the case of data stored in log files, this occurs no later than 14 days. Further storage is possible. In this
        case, the IP addresses of users are anonymized, so that assignment to the calling client is no longer possible.
    </p>
    <h3>Provision Required or Necessary:</h3>
    <p>The provision of the aforementioned personal data is neither legally nor contractually required.
        However, without the IP address, the service and functionality of our website cannot be guaranteed.
        Moreover, certain services and features may not be available or may be restricted. For this reason,
        an objection is excluded.</p>
    <h2>Contact Form</h2>
    <h3>Type and Purpose of Processing:</h3>
    <p>The data you provide will be stored for the purpose of individual communication with you.
        Providing a valid email address and your name is required.
        This information is used to assign and respond to your inquiry.
        Providing additional data is optional.</p>
    <h3>Legal Basis:</h3>
    <p>The processing of the data entered into the contact form is based on a legitimate interest (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR).
    </p>
    <p>By providing the contact form, we aim to facilitate easy contact with us.
        The information you provide will be stored for processing your request and for potential follow-up questions.
    </p>
    <p>If you contact us to request a quote, the processing of the data entered into the contact form is
        for the purpose of carrying out pre-contractual measures (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR).</p>
    <h3>Recipients:</h3>
    <p>Recipients of the data may be processors.</p>
    <h3>Storage Duration:</h3>
    <p>Data will be deleted no later than 6 months after processing the request.</p>
    <p>If a contractual relationship is established, we are subject to the statutory retention periods under the
        Commercial Code (HGB)
        and will delete your data after these periods have expired.</p>
    <h3>Provision Required or Necessary:</h3>
    <p>Providing your personal data is voluntary. However, we can only process your request if you provide us with your
        name,
        email address, and the reason for your inquiry.</p>
    <h2>SSL Encryption</h2>
    <p>To protect the security of your data during transmission, we use encryption methods that meet the current
        standards
        (e.g., SSL) via HTTPS.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Information on Your Right to Object Under Art. 21 GDPR</h2>
    <h3>Right to Object Based on Specific Situations</h3>
    <p>You have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data based on
        Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR (processing based on a balancing of interests),
        based on reasons arising from your particular situation; this also applies to
        profiling based on this provision as defined in Art. 4 (4) GDPR.</p>
    <p>If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can
        demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override
        your interests, rights, and freedoms, or the processing is necessary for the establishment,
        exercise, or defense of legal claims.</p>
